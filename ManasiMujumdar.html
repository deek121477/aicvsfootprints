      <h3 class="w3-center">Towards Eaton Pratibha award</h3>
      <p class="w3-center w3-large">By Manasi Mujumdar</p>

<div class="container-fluid p-5  content" >
    <p  >
        Having a 9 pointer throughout your 4 years of engineering should never be your sole aim, rather having 
exposure to 9 different opportunities should be your goal. Engineering today is about what you learn and 
how you grow apart from classroom teaching rather than just clearing your semesters without a backlog 
and Eaton’s Pratibha excellency award validates the same fact. It is a scholarship award offered by Eaton 
that recognizes exceptional women engineering students from leading engineering institutions in India 
that assess the candidates on academic as well as co-curricular achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most fascinating aspect of this award that should drive you towards participating in this opportunity is 
        not just the monetary reward but also the fact that it is offered to only two colleges from Maharashtra! This 
        award gives the participant an excellent chance to assess and to think about problems and their solutions 
        from an industrial perspective. You should be a final or pre-final year student studying in any of the 
        information and communication technology branches to compete for the award.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process of the award is divided into two stages namely the application round and the paper 
presentation round. A short orientation about the same is conducted prior by the company so make sure 
you do attend that and get all your doubts cleared about the entire process. In case you are wondering 
about the details of the orientation program then keep a lookout for the mail from your college’s 
placement cell, they’ve a plethora of opportunities waiting to be grabbed by each one of you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next comes the application form which is your first step towards the award. There’s only one line for your 
cgpa and the rest 2 pages are about your involvements in technical and non-technical activities so you 
can assess for yourself how important being involved in college fests, clubs, tech teams is. If you are a 
club member or a head, if you have won or participated in a sports activity, if you have coordinated an 
event during your college’s technical or cultural fest or volunteered for any activity then write all of it! 
Because the more programs you have been a part of the more your chances are to be shortlisted for the 
next and final round. Another highly important factor that is in fact the deciding criteria for the next round
is your community involvement. If you’ve been a part of any NGO or youth organization that works 
towards upliftment of underprivileged in the society then highlight it as glamorously as you can because 
this award looks for girls who not just grow individually but also help the society grow as a whole too.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last and the final round-paper is the paper presentation round. About 10 students from each college 
get shortlisted based on their application and resume. You will receive a mail from Eaton regarding the 
next steps which basically involves you choosing a topic for your presentation. These topics are provided 
by the company and are different for computer science and non-computer science branches. Choosing a 
theme which you like shouldn’t be the only reason why you select a topic rather I would suggest you 
choose a theme that not just matches your liking but has a great future prospect in the industry as well.
More specifically how Eaton could benefit from your solution. Often certain topics already have a lot of 
applications in the market and this round assess not only your knowledge but also how innovatively can 
you pitch in your idea or contribution towards a solution, no matter how small it is. That being said, if you 
really do aim to win this award <b>make sure you do give solution that has your thinking in it</b> along with 
the standard solutions because a company appreciates your effort to ideate or at least attempt to ideate a 
solution be it correct or not. You will be given about a month’s time to research on the topic so prepare an 
in depth solution and a power point presentation to be delivered to the Eaton executives. Stick to the topic 
and have a detailed flow chart explaining your thought process. Ensure your ppt is <b>short and ‘to the 
point’</b> having more figures and facts than long paragraphs, the industrial community doesn’t appreciate 
long texts on slides, rather it should be you who explains it with key points on the slide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rest assured remain confident about your topic and solution in those 10 minutes that you present, 
remember the deeper you engage with the topic the better appreciated your efforts are which would also 
help you answer the 5-minute question and answer round by the Eaton leaders on your topic. Top three 
contestants from each college are then awarded the prestigious Eaton Pratibha scholarship award with a 
Rs. 60,000 cash prize as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        To conclude, the Eaton Pratibha award is not just a great opportunity to get yourself well-versed with 
industrial expectations and technologies but also an amazing addition to your resume which would help 
you stand out amongst thousands applying for the same job or university. So go ahead and refresh your 
mailbox to see if the application process for the award has started or not!
